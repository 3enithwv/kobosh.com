I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows
They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze
I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told
I'm in my prime and this ain't even final form
They knocked me down, but still, my feet, they find the floor
I went from living rooms straight out to sold-out tours
Life's a fight, but trust, I'm ready for the war
Woah-oh-oh
This is how the story goes
Woah-oh-oh
I guess this is how the story goes
I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows
They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze
I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told
From the screen to the ring, to the pen, to the king
Where's my crown? That's my bling
Always drama when I ring
See, I believe that if I see it in my heart
Smash through the ceiling 'cause I'm reachin' for the stars
Woah-oh-oh
This is how the story goes
Woah-oh-oh
I guess this is how the story goes
I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows
They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze (woo)
I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told
Highway to heaven, I'm just cruisin' by my lone'
They cast me out, left me for dead, them people cold
My faith in God, mind in the sun, I'm 'bout to sow (yeah)
My life is hard, I took the wheel, I cracked the code (yeah-yeah, woah-oh-oh)
Ain't nobody gon' save you, man, this life will break you (yeah, woah-oh-oh)
In the thick of it, this is how the story goes
I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows
They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze
I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told
I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows (everybody knows)
They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze (yeah)
I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told (ooh-ooh)
Woah-oh-oh (nah-nah-nah-nah, ayy, ayy)
This is how the story goes (nah, nah)
Woah-oh-oh
I guess this is how the story goes

[ KSI - Thick Of It (feat. Trippie Redd) [Official Music Video] ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At8v_Yc044Y)

### The Evolution of KSI in "Thick of It" Feat. Trippie Redd: A Deep Dive into the Music Video and Lyrics

In today’s landscape of rapidly changing music trends, few figures embody the intersection of multiple worlds like KSI. Known for his rise from a YouTube personality to a multifaceted artist, KSI’s "Thick of It" featuring Trippie Redd is more than just another track in his discography; it is a statement of both artistic evolution and personal triumph. The song, paired with an official music video that reinforces its central themes, paints a picture of KSI’s journey—from the virtual world of YouTube to sold-out arenas—and highlights the tension between fame, struggle, and self-empowerment.

#### **KSI's Journey: From YouTube to Global Stardom**

KSI, born Olajide Olayinka Williams Olatunji, has been a prominent figure in the digital age, first making his mark with his gaming and comedic content on YouTube. His transition into music, boxing, and other ventures speaks to his ability to adapt and redefine himself continually. "Thick of It" represents the culmination of years of overcoming challenges, rising from the humble beginnings of a YouTube channel to creating an empire built on music, sports, and entrepreneurial endeavors.

The opening lyrics, "I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows," immediately set the tone for the track. KSI acknowledges his public recognition, suggesting that he is deeply embedded in the cultural consciousness. The phrase "the thick of it" can be interpreted as KSI's way of saying he is in the midst of the intensity and challenges that come with fame. Everyone knows him, but they might not fully understand what it takes to maintain that level of prominence.

#### **The Symbolism of Coldness and Ice**

The repeated line "They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze" carries both a literal and metaphorical weight. In the literal sense, KSI is acknowledging his global reach—his fame extends to places where it snows, hinting at international recognition. However, there is a deeper layer here: the juxtaposition of "skied in" and "froze" suggests that KSI's arrival into the public eye wasn’t met with open arms, but rather with resistance and skepticism. 

"I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold," KSI continues, shifting from the external world of ice and snow to an internal reflection of his emotional state. The coldness here can be seen as a reflection of his detachment, perhaps from the pressures of fame or the colder aspects of the entertainment industry. It's a toughened exterior that KSI has developed over the years as he has faced countless challenges, both personal and professional.

#### **The Rise of a Digital Icon**

The line "Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told" reflects KSI’s immense success on YouTube. With over 40 million subscribers at the time of writing, his channel remains one of the most influential in the platform’s history. This line not only boasts his subscriber count but also highlights the sheer scale of his influence. It serves as a reminder of how far he has come and reinforces his belief in the power of self-determination. KSI is no longer just a YouTuber; he's a global brand.

"I’m in my prime and this ain’t even final form" showcases his self-assurance. KSI isn’t resting on his laurels; he’s aware of his current success but acknowledges that this is just the beginning. The reference to "final form" alludes to the idea that KSI’s potential is still being realized and that he’s far from peaking. This sense of growth and transformation is vital to understanding his narrative, both in the context of his career and his personal journey.

#### **The Battle of Life: From Setbacks to Triumph**

The song is filled with metaphors that express KSI’s resilience. "They knocked me down, but still, my feet, they find the floor" acknowledges the struggles and setbacks KSI has faced—whether personal, professional, or emotional. His ability to find his footing after being "knocked down" speaks to his persistence and determination to overcome adversity. This resilience is a theme that runs throughout his career, evident in his transitions from music to boxing, and now back to music.

"Life's a fight, but trust, I'm ready for the war" is a powerful statement that echoes KSI's mentality towards life. He frames life itself as a battle, and his readiness to engage in that battle is key to his survival and success. It's an aggressive, yet empowering message that encourages listeners to persevere, no matter how difficult the circumstances may seem.

#### **The Influence of Trippie Redd**

Trippie Redd’s contribution to "Thick of It" adds a layer of emotional depth to the track. Known for his melodic trap style and emotional vulnerability, Trippie Redd brings a unique flavor to the song. His verse blends seamlessly with KSI’s aggressive, self-empowering tone. Trippie’s voice provides a contrast, adding an element of introspection that complements KSI’s more outwardly focused narrative. 

In the context of the song, Trippie Redd’s verse serves as a reminder of the darker sides of fame and success. His line "Highway to heaven, I'm just cruisin' by my lone'" expresses a sense of loneliness, despite being surrounded by millions. This echoes KSI’s earlier lines about feeling cold and isolated, and together they capture the complexity of fame—how it can simultaneously provide immense external validation while also creating a deep internal sense of solitude.

#### **Reaching for the Stars: Empowerment Through Struggle**

"I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows / I guess this is how the story goes" is the recurring refrain that frames the entire narrative. It speaks to KSI's journey: he has reached the apex of fame, and now he is simply living out his story, one that is shaped by both triumph and hardship. There’s a sense of acceptance here, as if KSI has come to terms with the narrative that has been written for him.

"See, I believe that if I see it in my heart / Smash through the ceiling 'cause I'm reachin' for the stars" is a declaration of belief in the power of self-vision and ambition. KSI’s confidence is rooted in his deep belief in his own capabilities. The idea of "smashing through the ceiling" suggests that he is not bound by limitations, and that no matter how high the stakes, he’s prepared to fight for what he wants.

#### **The Ultimate Triumph: A Story of Self-Realization**

The overall narrative of "Thick of It" is one of self-realization and empowerment. It reflects KSI’s personal and professional journey, capturing both the highs and the lows of life in the public eye. The lyrics reflect a man who has fought through adversity, maintained his integrity, and risen to the top, all while facing the constant pressure of expectations.

Through its themes of resilience, self-empowerment, and perseverance, "Thick of It" resonates with audiences who are familiar with the struggles of navigating a world full of obstacles. KSI’s collaboration with Trippie Redd brings a unique duality to the song, combining KSI’s bold, relentless energy with Trippie’s vulnerability and introspection. The music video, with its vivid imagery and dynamic pacing, complements these themes, adding a visual dimension to the song’s powerful message.

In conclusion, "Thick of It" is more than just a song; it is a testament to KSI’s evolution as an artist and as a person. It speaks to the complexity of fame, the trials of success, and the relentless pursuit of one’s dreams. For KSI, this is just the beginning of the story, and as the lyrics suggest, his journey is far from over. "Thick of It" stands as both a reflection on how far he has come and a reminder of the heights he still aims to reach.
